    <P>Having a job in IT almost guarantees you the ability to work from home. While more companies are returning to the office now, many software engineering departments are still allowed to work remotely.</P>
    <P>A huge part of working in IT is helping others with their problems. It requires patience, empathy, and tenacity. </P>
    <P>Typically, an employee makes friends only with those in their department. However, an IT pro interacts with a diverse range of individuals.</P>
    <P>It is one of the best jobs as an extrovert to make friends, and with those friends, connections.</P>
    <P>T is constantly evolving. Whether it's SD-WAN, virtualization or cloud technology, there is always a new skill to be learned. </P>
